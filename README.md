# WI-project/MAC-randomization

## Short Introduction
This project was accomplished for the Wireless Internet Course taught at Polimi during the academic year 2021/2022, and it revolves around the employment of MAC address randomization in modern mobile devices.

## Project Description
Modern smartphones randomize their MAC address during probe request emission. You are requested to produce a dataset characterizing the MAC randomization of your own device, following what done in the following paper: “A dataset of labelled device Wi-Fi probe requests for MAC address de-randomization” by L. Pintor and L. Aztori, Computer Networks, Vol. 205, March 2022.
The project should output a set of .pcap files, containing probe requests emitted from your smartphones in different conditions (screen on/off, Wi-Fi on/off, Power saving on/off) to characterize the randomization behaviour of your smartphone. A final report is required to describe your findings.

## What You Can Find Here
Since the project deals with possibly sensible data, it was decided to avoid uploading the captures, both unfiltered and filtered ones.
